This project that I was assigned was to create a virtual craps game. This also uses the Wheels API, however I had a lot of fun creating this project because it was one of the first “games” I ever created and I was extremely satisfied when it worked 100%. The goal of this project was to teach us about nested if/else statements. The game itself is pretty self explanatory, you start with a pool of money and can use the slider to adjust how much you want to bet, and based on what you roll it will either subtract your bet, or give you 2x, 3x, or 4x your bet. The main file where the application can be run is “CrapsApp.java”
